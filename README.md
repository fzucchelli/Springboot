This Repository covers all of the fundamentals of Spring boot. It covers Java Configuration, Annotation based Configuration, Beans and their Scopes, and Properties, Spring Security for securing Java applications built with Spring MVC.

Objective Of Repo:

introduces developers to the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot is a new way of looking at Spring development and Java applications. Developers will learn the core aspects of Spring Boot by coding through the basics with a sample application. First, is the stand-alone architecture of Spring Boot. No more containers and XML files. Your app runs as a pure Java app and can be deployed in any environment that runs Java, including cloud platforms. Second, developers will learn about the Spring Boot starters. These starters allow quick and easy integration with many Spring technologies and 3rd Party libraries and frameworks. Starters also provide the concept of auto-configuration allowing developers to incorporate concepts such as data sources or REST services. By the end of this course, developers will be able to understand the Spring Boot architecture and how it plugs in and works with core Spring. They will be able to install Spring Boot, configure it, and utilize many of the framework's features.
